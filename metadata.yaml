description: Tom Slade, bending over the office table, scrutinized the big map of
  Temple Camp. It was the first time he had really looked at it since his return from
  France, and it made him homesick to see, even in its cold outlines, the familiar
  things and scenes which he had so loved as a scout. The hill trail was nothing but
  a dotted line, but Tom knew it for more than that, for it was along its winding
  way into the dark recesses of the mountains that he had qualified for the pathfinder's
  badge. Black Lake was just an irregular circle, but in his mind's eye he saw there
  the moonlight glinting up the water, and canoes gliding silently, and heard the
  merry voices of scouts diving from the springboard at its edge. He liked this map
  better than maps of billets and trenches, and to him the hill trail was more suggestive
  of adventure than the Hindenburg Line. He had been very close to the Hindenburg
  Line and it had meant no more to him than the equator. He had found the war to be
  like a three-ringed circus - it was too big. Temple Camp was about the right size.
  Tom reached for a slip of paper and laying it upon the map just where the trail
  went over the hilltop and off the camp territory altogether, jotted down the numbers
  of three cabins which were indicated by little squares.
